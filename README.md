## This is an experimental job board site built with NextJS, Prisma ORM, NextAuth, Railway and TailWindCSS.

[Job Board](https://flaviocopes.notion.site/BOOTCAMP-Week-10-3a88f0844dc3495db394dbc60c3cb29f)

To run the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.


## To do
- Add the ability to set a “status” for the application, like “pending”, “in review”
- allow companies to edit job details
- enforce the “can’t reapply 2 times to the same job” in the API too, not just in the frontend
- prevent people to apply to unpublished jobs
